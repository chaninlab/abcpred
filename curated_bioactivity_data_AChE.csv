L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,513.64,5.25

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,499.62,4.86

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,660.3,9.03

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,520.03,5.13

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,625.86,8.38

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,597.8,7.59

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,590.17,7.08
