L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,625.86,8.38

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,597.8,7.59

G. L. Ellman et al., New and Rapid Colorimetric Determination of Acetylcholinesterase Activity Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, vol. 7, pp. 88-95). For eeAChE inhibitory activity determination, the reaction took place in a final volume of 300 uL of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered solution pH 8.0, containing 0.03 unit/mL of ee AChE and 333 uM 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (DTNB) solution used to produce the yellow anion of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid.

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,590.17,7.08

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,569.75,6.81

Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,632.25,8.25

L.; Courtney, K. D.; Anders, B.; Featherstone, R. M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88-95).This method of evaluation of the cholinesterase inhibitors activity is based on the fact that acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase interacts with the inhibitor, which prevents the acetyl/butyrylcholine hydrolysis. The inhibitor causes the enzyme activity drop which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration. The enzyme unbound with the inhibitor is able to hydrolyze acetyl/butyrylthiocholine (ASCh/BSCh). The amount of the hydrolyzed ASCh/BSCh is measured indirectly, by quantification of the product of its reaction with DTNB (5,5Ã¢Â²-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). Ellman's method relies therefore on the spectrophotometric quantification of product of the reaction between acylthiocholine and DTNB.","",2014,513.64,5.25
